## Data Source
Data is collected on the Versatile ECR ion source for NUclear Science (VENUS) at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. The data is collected under a Bayesian Optimizer policy, which can be found in another repo: [VENUS-Project](https://github.com/yubinhu/VENUS-Project)). The first two runs of the policy are in this repo, the third run is not uploaded.

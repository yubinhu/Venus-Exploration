# README
## Summary
This repo contains experiments fitting a Gaussian Regression model to the VENUS exploration data, a venus simulator based on the models, and subsequent Bayesian Optimization scripts generated for optimizing VENUS parameters. 

## Important files
- Scripts/GRonDatav2.0 contains the main experiments on model fitting
- Scripts/BayesOptVisualizer contains plots of visualized Bayesian Optimization experiment results. 

## Data Source
Data is collected on the Versatile ECR ion source for NUclear Science (VENUS) at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. The data is collected under a Bayesian Optimizer policy, which can be found in another repo: [VENUS-Project](https://github.com/yubinhu/VENUS-Project)). The first two runs of the policy are in this repo, the third run is not uploaded.
